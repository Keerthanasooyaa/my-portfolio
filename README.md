ðŸŒ¸ Portfolio Description

This portfolio is a Pinterest-inspired digital showcase designed to highlight both my technical skills and creative personality. Built with a soft pastel aesthetic, it blends professionalism with a personal touch â€” creating a welcoming space where code meets design.

âœ¨ Features:

Hero Section with my introduction, profile photo, and a downloadable resume.

About Me section with a personal photo, short bio, and quick links to GitHub and LinkedIn.

Projects & Gallery laid out in a Pinterest-style masonry grid, including my Photobooth Web App project and lifestyle images with aesthetic captions, so the portfolio feels lively even as I build more projects.

Skills Section that showcases my expertise in Python, C, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Contact Section with a direct email form and social links for easy networking.

This portfolio isnâ€™t just about listing skills â€” itâ€™s about creating a visual story that reflects my journey as a developer and as a creative individual.
